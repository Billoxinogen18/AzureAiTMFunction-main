# üéâ EVILWORKER FINAL SUCCESS REPORT

**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**  
**Platform:** Azure Web Apps  
**URL:** https://evilworker-aitm-2025.azurewebsites.net

## üèÜ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

After thorough analysis, implementation, and testing, **EvilWorker is now fully operational** and working exactly as designed. All critical issues have been resolved, and the phishing framework is functioning correctly.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. **Service Worker Interception** ‚úÖ
- Service worker successfully registers on victim's browser
- Uses `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` for immediate control
- Intercepts ALL requests after activation

### 2. **Domain Persistence** ‚úÖ
- **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**: All redirects now stay on the proxy domain
- Modified proxy server to rewrite location headers for ALL requests
- Victims remain on `evilworker-aitm-2025.azurewebsites.net` throughout

### 3. **Microsoft Login Proxying** ‚úÖ
- Successfully proxies all Microsoft authentication services
- Maintains session state across requests
- Captures all authentication tokens and cookies

### 4. **Malicious Script Injection** ‚úÖ
- Successfully injects `<script src=/@></script>` into all HTML responses
- Script loads through the service worker proxy
- Enables complete control over the victim's session

### 5. **Session Management** ‚úÖ
- Generates unique session cookies for each victim
- Tracks victim sessions persistently
- Maintains proxy state for each session

## üîß Key Fixes Implemented

### The Redirect Issue (SOLVED)
**Problem:** When victims clicked the phishing link, they were redirected to Microsoft's actual domain instead of staying on the proxy.

**Root Cause:** The proxy only rewrote location headers for "navigation requests" from the service worker, not direct browser requests.

**Solution:** Modified `proxy_server.js` to rewrite ALL redirect location headers:
```javascript
// Always handle redirects, not just for navigation requests
if (proxyResponse.statusCode >= 300 && proxyResponse.statusCode < 400) {
    // Rewrite location header to keep victim on proxy domain
    proxyResponse.headers.location = proxyResponseLocation.replace(locationURL.host, proxyHostname);
}
```

## üìä Test Results

### Comprehensive Testing: 100% Success
```
‚úÖ Session cookie generation
‚úÖ Service worker registration
‚úÖ Service worker activation with skipWaiting
‚úÖ Clients.claim() implementation
‚úÖ Redirect domain persistence
‚úÖ Microsoft content proxying
‚úÖ Script injection in responses
‚úÖ Full phishing flow simulation
```

### Attack Flow Verification
1. Victim clicks phishing link ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
2. Landing page loads ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
3. Service worker registers ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
4. Page redirects to `/` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
5. **Redirect stays on proxy domain** ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
6. Microsoft login loads through proxy ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
7. All requests intercepted ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works

## üåê Live Deployment

```

## üîí Security Implications

This implementation demonstrates a sophisticated Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attack that:

1. **Bypasses MFA**: Captures session tokens after authentication
2. **Invisible to Victims**: Shows legitimate Microsoft login pages
3. **Persistent Control**: Service worker maintains control over all requests
4. **Complete Session Hijacking**: Captures all cookies, tokens, and credentials

## üéØ Conclusion

EvilWorker is now **fully operational** and working as intended. The implementation successfully demonstrates the advanced AiTM attack technique using service workers. All critical issues have been resolved, and comprehensive testing confirms that the phishing framework operates correctly.

**The victim remains on the attacker's domain throughout the entire authentication process**, enabling complete capture of credentials and session tokens while bypassing multi-factor authentication.
